  ## Real estate app Dom
 
 In this project I used:
 - Expo
 - React hook form
 - Mobx
 - React native navigation
 - Styled components
 
 ![](./assets/Screenrecorder-native.gif){:height="auto" width="50%"}.

 All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by expo.
 
 You can run this project locally just do:
 - clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/helljack26/dom-native2.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
 - `cd dom-native2`
 - `npm install` 
 - `npm start`
