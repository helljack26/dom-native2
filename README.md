  ## Real estate Android/IOS app "Dom"
 
 In this project I used:
 - Expo
 - React native
 - React native navigation
 - React hook form
 - Mobx
 - Styled components

 All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by expo.
 
 You can run this project locally just do:
 - clone branch `main` with `git clone https://github.com/helljack26/dom-native2.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
 - `cd dom-native2`
 - `npm install` 
 - `npm start`
